The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.

These Terms of Use are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services or when you cease using your account.

In no event shall any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Use be construed against the drafting party.
