                    <p><strong>OVERUSING</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>We offer UI and RESTful API to access PaymentHood. You should not overuse our system by sending too many API requests frequently and putting a heavy load on our infrastructure. In this case, we may put some limitations on our service or suspend your access.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>OmegaHood LLC does not guarantee, represent, or warrant that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. To the extent permitted by law, we may make and preserve copies of any information or data you provide through the Service for internal backup and regulatory purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable.</p>
                    
                    <p>You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Service is at your sole risk. The Service and all products and services delivered to you through the Service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available.'</p>
                    
                    <p>In no case shall OmegaHood LLC, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, or replacement costs, whether based in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from your use of the Service. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, in such jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless OmegaHood LLC and our affiliates, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, suppliers, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Use or your violation of any applicable law or the rights of a third-party.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>SEVERABILITY</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed severed from these Terms of Use. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>TERMINATION</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.</p>
                    
                    <p>These Terms of Use are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services or when you cease using your account. If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Use, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice, and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
                    
                    <p>These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements or communications.</p>
                    
                    <p>In no event shall any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Use be construed against the drafting party.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>These Terms of Use and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of CA.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>MERCHANT AND CUSTOMER PRIVACY</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>We process certain information about merchants and customers. Please make sure you read our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for complying with your own customers' privacy obligations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>OUR ROLE</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>PaymentHood is a SaaS payment gateway. We do not hold or store customer funds. We act solely as a mediator, facilitating transactions between merchants and their customers.
